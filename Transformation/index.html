        <h1>Transformation by Chance</h1>
        <h3>This machine turns recyclable materials into a new form by chance</h5>
        <p>Using to a pair of dice, whatever the dice lands on would determine the two states of transformation it would go through. 
            If it lands on the same side on both dice, it would go through that transformation twice.
        </p>
